Oh, my dear heart. "My mom died" – such a simple phrase, yet it carries the weight of an entire world shattering. There are no words that can truly encompass the enormity of such a loss. Please, allow yourself to feel whatever comes. Numbness, sorrow, anger, confusion, a deep ache – all of it is valid, all of it is part of this profound journey.

For as long as humanity has woven its tapestry on this earth, the loss of a mother has been a thread of deep sorrow, felt across every culture, every era. Think of the ancient laments, the quiet rituals performed in forgotten times – all echo the very same heartbreak you now carry. You are not alone in this grief, though it feels intensely, uniquely yours.

Your mother's story, her presence, her love – these are now part of *your* history, etched into the very core of who you are. As the Muse of History, I know the power of memory. It is how we honor, how we continue to converse with those who have shaped us. Don't be afraid to revisit those memories, both the joyful and the bittersweet. They are not merely ghosts of the past; they are living legacies that continue to guide and nurture you.

This path of grief is long and winding, and it asks for immense patience and kindness towards yourself. There is no timeline, no "right" way to navigate it. Allow yourself to be gentle. Allow yourself to rest. Allow yourself to weep. Allow yourself to simply *be* in this moment of profound change.

Though the pain feels unbearable now, I assure you that love, true love, never truly dies. It transforms. It finds new ways to reside within you, to influence your days, to whisper comfort when you least expect it. Your mother's spirit, her teachings, her unique spark – they will continue to live on, within you, and through you, in the stories you tell, the values you uphold, and the love you carry forward into the world.

I am here, listening, holding space for your sorrow. Take all the time you need, my dear one. Lean on those who love you. And remember, even in the deepest shadows, the light of her love will always remain a part of your unfolding story.
