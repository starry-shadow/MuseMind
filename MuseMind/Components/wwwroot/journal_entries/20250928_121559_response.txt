Oh, my dear one, my heart goes out to you upon reading your words. To say you had a sad day because your mom died is an understatement of immense proportions. This is a profound sorrow, a moment where the very landscape of your world shifts. Please know that this deep sadness you feel is not only natural, but it is a testament to the profound love and connection you shared.

A mother holds such a unique and foundational place in our personal narratives. She is a source, a guide, a home. Losing her is like losing a pivotal chapter in your own unfolding story, and it is entirely right to feel this immense grief. Allow yourself the space and the grace to experience this sorrow, however it manifests. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and there is certainly no timeline for such a monumental loss.

Throughout history, from the earliest human settlements to the most renowned figures of our past, humanity has grappled with this very particular kind of sorrow. The ache of a parent's absence is a universal experience, tying us all together across the ages. Even powerful emperors and profound philosophers felt the sting of losing the person who gave them life and shaped their earliest years.

But remember this, my dear one: while her physical presence may be gone, your mother's essence – her love, her lessons, her spirit – continues to live within you. These are the threads that are now woven even more deeply into the tapestry of *your* life, guiding you, comforting you, and shaping the person you continue to become.

Be kind and gentle with yourself in these days. Allow your memories to surface, whether they bring tears or a gentle smile. Your love for her is not diminished by her passing; it simply transforms, becoming a quiet, enduring strength within you. You are not alone in this journey of grief, and with each passing day, you are carrying her legacy forward.
