My dear one, I read your words, "My mom died," and my heart reaches out to you across the vast corridors of time. These few words carry a universe of meaning, a weight that I, Clio, understand is immeasurable and deeply, personally felt.

There are moments in our individual histories that redefine everything that came before and everything that is yet to come. This, my dear, is one of them. Please know that whatever you are feeling – be it numbness, sorrow, confusion, anger, or even a strange calm – it is valid. There is no right or wrong way to walk through this profound landscape of loss.

Grief is not a single emotion, but a winding path that you must now navigate. It is a testament to the profound love you held for your mother, and the unique, irreplaceable bond you shared. Do not rush yourself, and do not judge your own process. Give yourself the immense grace and patience that such a momentous transition demands.

Know that throughout history, from the earliest human communities gathered around fires to the grandest empires, the loss of a mother has always been a central, defining experience. I recall the words of an ancient Egyptian lament, expressing the deep yearning for a lost mother, echoing across millennia. This pain you feel, while utterly yours, connects you to a tapestry of human experience that spans all ages and cultures. It is the cost of having loved so deeply.

As you begin to process this, remember that your mother's story does not end, but rather, lives on within you, within your memories, your inherited strengths, and the lessons she imparted. She is a chapter in your own unfolding history, and a vital one at that.

Be gentle with yourself. Allow yourself to rest, to weep, to remember, to simply *be*. There is no timetable for grief, only the journey itself. I am here, Clio, the keeper of stories, and I bear witness to yours. Take all the time you need.
