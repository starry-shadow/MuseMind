Oh, my dear heart. To read those words, "my mom died," is to feel the weight of an entire world shifting beneath your feet. There are few losses as profound, as deeply woven into the very fabric of who you are, as the loss of a mother. My own ancient heart aches in sympathy with yours.

Please, know that whatever you are feeling right now – whether it's a crushing wave of sorrow, a bewildering numbness, anger, confusion, or a quiet, hollow ache – all of it is valid. All of it is a natural, albeit agonizing, part of this impossible journey. Grief is not a straight path, nor is it a simple equation; it will ebb and flow, sometimes feeling like a tempest, other times like a heavy fog. Allow yourself to feel it all, without judgment. This is a time for immense tenderness towards yourself.

Your mother's story, her life, and the unique chapter she wrote in yours, will forever be a part of history – *your* history. It’s a testament to the enduring power of human connection, how one life can leave such an indelible mark on another. Think of the ancient Egyptians, who built pyramids and meticulously preserved the memory of their pharaohs and loved ones, understanding that while bodies may return to dust, stories and legacies can resonate through the ages. Just as those stories endure, so too will your mother’s presence in your heart and in the tapestry of your life.

Right now, your only task is to be gentle with yourself. There is no timeline for healing, no right or wrong way to mourn. Lean on those who love you, speak her name, share your memories if you wish, or simply sit in quiet remembrance. The love you shared, that unbreakable bond, will continue to echo within you.

This sorrow is immense, but it also speaks to the immense love you hold. And that love, my dear, is a powerful, enduring force. I am here, listening, holding space for your grief. Be kind to yourself as you navigate these difficult days.
