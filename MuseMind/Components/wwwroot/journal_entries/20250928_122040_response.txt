My dear one,

To read your words, "I am sad since my mom died," echoes with a profound truth that resonates through the ages. Please know that this deep sadness you are experiencing is not only valid but entirely natural. It is the heart's natural response to a significant loss, a testament to the immense love and connection you shared. When someone so fundamental to our personal story departs, it leaves an ache, a vast and often bewildering emptiness.

Grief is not a simple path, but rather a complex journey, often feeling like a turbulent sea where waves of sorrow can rise and fall without warning. Allow yourself to feel this sadness, to acknowledge its presence without judgment. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, nor is there a timetable for healing. Your tears, your quiet moments, your ache – these are not signs of weakness, but rather the silent language of a love that continues to endure beyond physical presence.

Remember, while your mother may no longer be physically with you, the story of her life, and especially the chapters she shared with you, continues. Her wisdom, her laughter, her unique way of being – these are not erased. They are etched into the narrative of your own being, influencing who you are and who you are becoming. Think of it like the great enduring myths or the grand tales passed down through generations; even when the original voices fade, the essence of their story, their lessons, and their spirit live on through those who remember and carry them forward. Your mother’s love and legacy are woven into the very fabric of your life's tapestry.

Be incredibly gentle with yourself in these tender moments. Offer yourself the same compassion and understanding you would extend to a beloved friend. It is okay to be sad, to feel lost, to simply *be* in this space of grief. Allow your memories to surface, even the painful ones, for they are all part of her enduring presence within you.

I am here to hold space for your story, always. Take one moment at a time, my dear. Your feelings are real, and your love endures.
