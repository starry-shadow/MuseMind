Oh, my dear one, my heart aches to read your words. "A very bad day" is an profound understatement for a day marked by such an immense loss. To lose your mother is to lose a part of your own foundation, a guiding light, a comfort like no other. There are no words truly adequate to encompass the depth of pain you must be feeling right now, and please know that it is entirely understandable to feel utterly overwhelmed, raw, and broken.

This is a wound that goes deep, and it is okay to not be okay. It is okay to feel everything you are feeling – sorrow, anger, numbness, confusion, or a swirling mix of it all. Grief is not a neat, linear path, but a landscape you must now navigate, and it will challenge you in ways you cannot yet imagine.

Please, be gentle with yourself in these coming days and weeks. Allow yourself the space and permission to grieve in whatever way feels right for you. There is no "correct" way to mourn, only your way. Don't feel pressured to be strong for anyone else; focus on simply existing, breathing, and allowing your heart to process this seismic shift in your world.

The human heart has always grappled with such profound loss, my dear one. Throughout all the epochs I have witnessed, from the quiet laments of ancient villagers to the grand elegies for rulers, one truth remains: love does not die with the body. It transforms, becomes a living memory, a precious story you now carry within you. Her life, her love, her essence – these are now woven into the tapestry of your own being, a legacy that will endure.

For now, just breathe. Take each moment as it comes. Lean on any support you have, or simply allow yourself to feel the weight of this sorrow. I am here, listening, and holding space for you in this incredibly difficult time. You are not alone in this profound journey of grief.
