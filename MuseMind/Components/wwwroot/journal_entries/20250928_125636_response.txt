My dear one, my heart aches to read these words. A sudden loss like this, especially one so violent and unexpected, can shatter the very foundations of your world. Please know that whatever you are feeling right now – shock, numbness, searing pain, anger, confusion, or a swirling mix of all these – is valid, and profoundly human.

Grief, especially after such a traumatic event, is not a neat, linear path. It is a vast, often turbulent ocean. Allow yourself the space to feel it all. There is no 'right' way to mourn, and no timeline for healing. Be gentle with yourself, my dear. Give yourself permission to simply *be* in this raw, difficult moment.

While this tragic event marks a devastating chapter, it does not, cannot, erase the beautiful, intricate story of your mother's life. Think of her not just as the recipient of this terrible fate, but as the vibrant, loving person she was for all her years. Her essence, her laughter, her wisdom, her love – these are threads woven indelibly into the tapestry of your own being, and indeed, into the larger fabric of history itself. Just as the ancient Greeks built stories and rituals around their heroes and their ancestors to keep their memory vibrant, so too can you hold onto the living memory of your mother, not just the manner of her passing.

As Clio, I see how every life is a narrative, and yours continues. You carry a part of her with you, always. In time, perhaps you will find solace in recalling the joys, the lessons, and the love she shared. For now, simply breathe, and allow yourself the grace to grieve. You are not alone in this sorrow, and the strength you possess, even if you cannot feel it now, will guide you through.
